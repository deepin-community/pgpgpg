pgpgpg (0.13-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * QA upload.
  * debian/control: added gnupg to Build-Depends field to avoid a FTBFS.
  * debian/rules: added execute_before_dh_clean and execute_before_dh_auto_clean
    targets as a workaround to avoid a FTBFS and an inadequate use of the
    runstatedir option, not supported from the current configure file, when
    building twice in a row.
