                     Compiling and Installing pgpgpg
                   ===================================

    Pgpgpg  uses  the  well  known  GNU  autoconf/automake  framework to
provide an easy to use configure script to compile and install pgpgpg.
    
    In  the  section named `Prerequisites' you will find a list with all
programms and tools needed to run and/or compile pgpgpg.

    In  the  `Quick Install'  section you will find a short step by step
procedure  to  configure,  compile  and  install  pgpgpg from the source
distribution.

    To find out more about pgpgpg specific configure options look at the
section named `Supported Options'.

    To find out all about standard features provided by configure please
look  at  the  file  named INSTALL.generic. This file is provided by the 
GNU  autoconf/automake  framework  and  discuss  all  aspects  of  using 
configure.



Prerequisites
-------------
    To run pgpgpg you need GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard). GnuPG can be found
on http://www.gnupg.org/

    To  build  and install pgpgpg you need an ANSI C compiler and a make
tool.  Pgpgpg is developed under Linux with the Gnu C Compiler (gcc) and 
Gnu  Make  but  normally pgpgpg should compile with all ANSI C compilers 
and  most  make  tool  available on unix plattforms. If you encounter in
some  trouble  on  compiling pgpgpg with a specific compiler please feel
free to drop me a mail.



Quick Install
-------------
    Make  sure  that your current working directory is equal to the root
directoy of the pgpgpg source distribution and then perform these steps:

    1.) Run  configure  to  determine  all  plattform specific issues by
        typing "./configure".

    2.) Type "make" to compile pgpgpg.

    3.) To install pgpgpg just type "make install".

The resulting binary is called `pgpgpg' and will be by default installed
in /usr/local/bin/pgpgpg.



Supported Options
-----------------
    --enable-debug
    
            With  this option you can request debugging message printing
        during pgpgpg execution. This is only usefull for bug hunting or
        if you would like participate on pgpgpg developing.

    --with-gpg-path=GPG_PATH
        
            GPG_PATH  is  a  path to the gpg programm executable. If you
        omit  this  option,  configure tries to find gpg in your current
        $PATH environment.
