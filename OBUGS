This is a list with bugs which are fixed and the dates when they were fixed:


[3]   "pgpgpg +batch some_detach_sign.asc" don't look for ome_detach_sign'
      but waits for data on stdin. Without +batch' gpg ask the user for the
      file. That's wrong! pgpgpg should check if the file is a detached
      signature and if yes, should call gpg with --verify'.

[5]   On some systems their are some problems with getopt().
